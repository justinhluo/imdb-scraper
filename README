The dataset we are using comes from kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset#movies_metadata.csv which contains information 
for over 45,000 movies. The information contains fields such as genre, IMDB id,budget, runtime, studio, country, etc. We will use 
beautiful soup to scrape imdb ratings, metacritic ratings, and IMDB ids from https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?count=100&groups=top_1000&sort=user_rating
which lists the top 1000 imdb movies. Later we can match the ratings with its corresponding movie through the 
IMDB id.

to run the scraper, type python top1000.py
This will generate a .csv file named top1000.csv
